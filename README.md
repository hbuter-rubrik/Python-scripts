# Python-scripts
Some example Python scripts I wrote using the Rubrik Pythin SDK

- get rubrik oracle database id.py - asks to input the oracle database name and the hostname and will print the Rubrik oracle database ID

- report download - provide report name and download path in script to download a CSV file of the report
